            <p>500 years ago, all the brazilian territory belonged to indians. With the growth of society and the need for space for farming and creating animals, their land was being stolen and their people killed. On the last 100 years, thanks to actvists and protests, the indian population started to grow again. But their lands continue to be taken, and their blood continues to spill. <br>More than 225 brazilian tribes are asking for your help to have what is theirs, to put and end to this war. </p>
